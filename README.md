# firewall-task

The firewall (UFW) was used to block and test traffic on port 23 (Telnet). The rule was verified using a local telnet attempt. SSH access (port 22) was allowed to ensure remote connectivity. Finally, the Telnet block was removed to restore the firewall to its original state. This exercise demonstrates basic firewall rule management and traffic control using UFW on a Linux system.
